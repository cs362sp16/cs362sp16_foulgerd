Getting the diffdom script to work might require that you change the other
students code in a way that is more consistent with the way that I use my
Makefile. 

After generating a diff using different seeds, it is very easy to tell which one
is different, but it is very hard to tell which one is correct or MORE correct.
For example, the other users code would generate different number of players
or purchase different cards. However, it seems that overall, the same functions
that are called will pass. It isn't very ideal to use differential testing,
because it is possible that both implementations are correct. However, one may
or may not be more correct than the other. 

I was able to obtain 61.17% code coverage. With my classmate's code, I got
58%.
