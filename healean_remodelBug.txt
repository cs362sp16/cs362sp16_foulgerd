In remodel

Description: this bug returns a 0 instead of a -1, meaning that all tests will
pass using remodel. Not only that, but remodel will always pass and could lead
to undersirable results when playing the game.

How to produce: when using remodel, make sure to pass in a card for choice 1
that is greater than the card passed in for choice 2.

Priority and severity: The priority for this should be medium, but the severity
should be low. I say this because the game is still playable, but you may get
undesirable results.
