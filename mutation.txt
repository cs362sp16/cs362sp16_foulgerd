Overall, mutation testing was interesting to learn about. It required me to 
learn more than what I already knew. That being said, I used the tool 
"cmutate" to generate 157 mutations of dominion.c. Out of the 157, 133 of them
passed all of my unit tests and only 24 of them failed my unit tests. That
means that 133 of the mutants were killed.

Normally this means that the test suite I have created is pretty good. However,
I believe that my unit tests are too simple. Most of the cards I use return 
simple values like -1 or 0. I think that this means that more tests are passing
when I think they should end up failing. For example, I decided to look at one
of the mutants to see what it changed and created a diff of the mutant and
dominion. This one happened to change the for loop for smithy so that it 
doesn't deal any cards. This will always pass due to the return value. It's also
possible the cmutate created many duplicates. However, that being said, my test 
suite could actually be killing these mutants.
