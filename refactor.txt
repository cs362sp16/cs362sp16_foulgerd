I have refactored the five cards: smithy, village, remodel, great hall, and steward.

I used the same method of extraction for all of the cards modified. In order to
do this correctly, I first had to create a variable called "toReturn." This
variable is used to return the original value of the cards back to the game.
As far as extraction goes, I copied and pasted each card into a new function.
I then made sure that each card received the variables they needed.
