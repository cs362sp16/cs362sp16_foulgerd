I tested the functions drawcard, shuffle, buycard, and endturn. I also tested 
the cards smithy, village, ambassador, and council room.

When testing the card "gardens", I noticed it didn't add to code coverage. I 
think this is because the card doesn't do anything special besides return 
negative one. I decided to test another card though. As far as coverage goes, 
my functions look like they are testing about 15 to 23 percent of dominion.c 
each. Each card test covered about 17 to 21 percent of dominion.c. When all
the tests were run together, total code coverage was about 31 percent of 
dominion.c.

As far as testing goes, my tests are rather simplistic. I am basically testing
that each function and card completed correctly or not. That means that my 
tests don't really account for any accidentals or incorrect behavior.

Note: If you want to run all the tests you can use the "make alltests" make
command. This will dump the results of all the tests into unittestresults.out
